\section{Results}
Orientation selectivity(OS) has been studied extensively in cat and monkey since its discovery by Hubel and Wiesel in the primary visual cortex(V1). When presented with oriented bar stimuli, the response of the a V1 neuron increases when the bar is optimally oriented in a certain direction. In these animals anatomically proximate neurons in the V1 have very similar preferred orientation forming orientation maps. Orientation maps  OS neurons are neatly arranged to from pinwheel-like patterns. Each pinwheel has a singularity at the center and orientation domains away from the center. Assuming connection probabilities drop with anatomical distance, neurons receive inputs mostly from neurons of the similar PO. It has been proposed that strong OS is possible only in the presence of functional connectivity. A functional connectivity where neurons with similar orientation preference have a higher probability of connection.\\
However, strong OS has also been observed in rat, mouse and squirrel. Neurons in V1(L2/3) of these rodents show strong OS without orientation maps. The OS neurons in the rodent V1 are arranged in a salt and pepper fashion where the POs of neurons are interspersed forming no discernible pattern. In addition, the evidence for functional connectivity in V1 of rodents is mixed. How can strong orientation selectivity be achieved without a functional architecture? Since there is strong OS in rodent V1 in spite of an orientation map, it was it was hypothesized that rodent V1 should posses a functional architecture. Hansel and van Vreeswijik proposed an alternative solution. They showed that strong feature selectivity can be achieved in purely random networks under very general conditions. In their model, the recurrent dynamics of the network is such that the total inhibitory and excitatory currents cancel each other. Each neuron in the network receives inputs from other neurons of different POs. Hence the the total input has a large untuned component and a comparably weak tuned part. As noted earlier, the large untuned component is dynamically suppressed and the weakly tuned input is amplified by the single neuron threshold nonlinearity. Both the excitatory and inhibitory populations exhibit strong OS. In fact, this is generic result showing that a randomy connected network of neurons with strong synapses can develop feature selectivity. Which is true only when the total exitatory and inhibitory currents that each neuron receives are approximately equal. \\ 
% Recently, Hansel \& Vreeswijk \cite{Hansel2012} showed that a functional connectivity is not a necessary ingredient for the achievement of strong orientation selectivity. They showed that in a purely random network, strong orientation selectivity can arise provided that cortex in operating in the balanced State. In fact, this is generic result showing that a randomy connected network of neurons with strong synapses can develop feature selectivity. Which is true only when the total exitatory and inhibitory currents that each neuron recieves are approximately equal. \\ 
The inhibitory population in the study of Hansel \& Vreeswijk \cite{Hansel2012} had tuning properties very similar to the excitatory population. This is not compatible with recent experimental results which clearly indicate that inhibitory population(PV\textsuperscript{+}) is more broadly tuned than excitatory neurons. But, here we show that this can be explained when the inhibotory neurons(PV\textsuperscript{+}) in L2/3 recieve recieve more numerous and weaker synapses from L4 than the excitatory population. This is a prediction which has to be tested in future experiments. There is already some evidence from the barrel cortex of the mouse suggesting that such a bias in the number of feedforward inputs the excitatory and inhibitory population. Hence, in all our simulations, we assumed that the inhibory population in L2/3 revieces weaker and more numerous inputs than the excitatory population($K_{ff}^{E} = 100, \; K_{ff}^{I} = 800$). This gives us mean values of Circular variance($CircVar = 1 - OSI$) that are comparable to the exprimental numbers. 
%Although OS has been studied for over 40 years, the mechanism by which feature seletivity arises in the cortex still debated. Here is an example tuning curve from a V1 neuron of the mouse. % The neurons in the V1 of these animals are orgainzed in what is called a salt and pepper fashion, where there is no dercernable arangement of neurons according to their preferred orinetation as we had seen for the Cat. And in addtion to this fact, the evidence for fuctional connectivity in V1 of rodents is mixed. So the question that arises is 'How can strong orientation selectivity be achieved without a functional architecture?

\subsection{Numerical simulations}
We studied the effects of bidirectionality in a conductance based model of rodent V1 L2/3 developed my Hansel and van Vreeswijk \cite{Hansel2012}. 
% Neurons in L2/3 rodent V1 show strong OS which are arranged in a salt and pepper fashion. However in primates like Cat and Monkey, the neurons are arranged in a manner such that anatomically close by neurons have similar PO. Such an arrangement leads to the well documented orientaion maps. Thus, it was hypothesized that strong OS requires a functional architecture where neurons with similar OS are connected to each other. Since there is no strong OS in rodent V1 in spite of an orientation map, it was it was claimed that rodent V1 should posses functional architecture. Hansel and van Vreeswijik proposed an alternative solution. They showed that strong feature selectivity can be achieved in purely random networks under very general conditions. In their model, the recurrent dynamics of the network is such that the total inhibitory and excitatory currents cancel each other. Each neuron in the network recieves inputs from other neurons of different POs. Hence the the total input has a large untuned component and a comparably weak tuned part. As noted earlier, the large untuend component is dynamically suppressed and the weakly tuned input is amplified by the single neuron threshold nonlinearity. Both the excitatory and inhibitory populations exhibit strong OS. However, there is a growting concensus that PV$^{+}$ cells are broadly tuned in ordents. We discovered that, it is possible to explain broadly tuned inhibitory cells by incorporating more numerous and weaker feed-forward input to the inhibitory population. \\
The connectivity matrix ($N \times N$)in their study was random with each neuron in the network receiving $K$ inputs on average. In such networks, there are $\frac{K^2}{N}$ bidirectional connections just by chance. Excess bidirectionality was introduced in the network such that the number of such connections were above chance level with a probability $p$, giving an average $pK$ number of bidirectional connections. Excess bidirectionality was introduced in all the three possible combinations of Excitatory(E) and Inhibitory(I) populations(E-to-E, I-to-I, and E-to-I).Using the modified model with broadly tuned inhibitory population we characterized the the spiking irregularity, fluctuations and, response properties of the L2/3 model network with excess bidirectionality. 
%The firing rate, circular variance and Fano factor distributions were computed for each 
% \textbf{â€¢}case.\\
%\emph{Spiking irregularity and fluctuations}
Excess E-to-E bidirectionality has been observed experimentally at probabilities of (0.2- 0.3) [REFerence]. The simulations show that E-to-E bidirectionality has negligible effects even at high levels of bidirectionality (Fig. \ref{fig:e2e0} \& Fig. \ref{fig:e2e1}). The firing rate distribution for networks with bidirectional probability(p) as high as 0.8 show no noticeable change as it approximately overlaps with control(p = 0, i.e random network) condition. Similarly, tuning properties(quantified using Circular variance) and Fano factor distributions of the both the excitatory and inhibitory populations remain unchanged compared to control. \\
In contrast to E-to-E reciprocity, adding I-to-I bidirectionality is much more efficacious in slowing down the fluctuations as is clearly seen in the population averaged AC function(Fig. \ref{fig:i2i0}). As a result the neurons become prone to fire in bursts.(Fig. \ref{fig:vmtrace})
At experimentally observed levels of bidirectional probabilities (which is estimated to be in the range 0.2-0.3 \cite{Song2005}), the tuning properties remain unchanged (Fig. \ref{fig:i2i1}a, Fig. \ref{fig:i2i1}b).
The population averaged Fano factor increases with increasing reciprocity(Fig. \ref{fig:i2i1}c, Fig. \ref{fig:i2i1}d). Thus, I-to-I bidirectionality slows down fluctuations and enhances response variability. However, E-to-I has the opposite effect. Fluctuations decay much faster than in a random network and Fano factor is reduced (Fig. \ref{fig:e2i0}). E-to-I bidirectionality leads to and increase in negative serial correlations in the spiking activity. As mentioned earlier, negative serial correlations reduces the Fano factor(Eq. \ref{ffcveq}). Thus,  with right probabilities of I-to-I and E-to-I reciprocity, it is possible to obtain a network where their individual effects will cancel each other. \\
We also investigated the effect of reciprocity in the presence of slow synapses, the time constants of recurrent and feed forward synapses were increased. Fig. \ref{fig:slowsyn0} shows that slow synapses and strong I-to-I bidirectionality lead to a large increase in the decorrelation times and Fano factors.\\  A fully random network is characterized by a single stable state and is independent of initial conditions. Fig. \ref{fig:slowsyn0}e shows that steady state firing rates of all the neurons converge to nearby values even though the simulations are started with different initial conditions. Slow synapses along with large I-to-I bidirectionality results in mutistability in the networks.(Fig. \ref{fig:slowsyn0}f) shows that different initial conditions leads to the network converging to different steady states. To ensure that the this was not an effect of poor firing rate estimates, these simulations were run for longer times(250s). Hence the steady state firing rates of the neurons depends on the initial conditions.
%A fully random network is characterized by a single ground state. Fig. \ref{fig:slowsyn0}e shows that steady state firing rates of all the neurons converge to nearby values even though the simulations are started with different initial conditions. On the other hand, a fully bidirectional network is very similar to a diluted spin glass. Thus a replica symmetry breaking (RSB) may be expected in this case. Therefore, as the level of bi-directionality is increased one can expect glassy behaviour to appear with a slowing down of the fluctuations. In the simulations this is seen in the presence of slow synapses at high levels of bidirectionality (Fig. \ref{fig:slowsyn0}f).
Thus, we show that excess bidirectional connections between I-to-I slow down the fluctuations in the neuronal input in balanced networks. As a result, the autocorrelation of the activity decays more slowly than in the corresponding ErdÃ¶s-RÃ©nyi network. Furthermore, bidirectional connections between I cells increase the Fano factor of the spike count. These phenomena are due to the small loops that the bidirectionality induces in the network architecture. Together with the relatively strong synapses in balanced networks these lead to a non-negligible effective delayed self-coupling. On the other hand E-to-I bidirectionality reduces the decorrelation time and response variability. Slow synapses and I-to-I bidirectionality lead to a further increase in decorrelation time and promote multistability.

%Remarkably, bidirectional connections between I cells are more efficacious in slowing down the dynamics than those between E cells. 
%We show that a balanced network model of rodent V1 with conductance-based spiking neurons and excess biderctionality behaves qualitatively similarly to the binary network.
