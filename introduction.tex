Recent experiments reveal the existence of a fine connectivity structure in cortical networks. The local network architecture of pyramidal cells in the cortex are significantly different from an Erdös-Rényi network. The pyramidal neurons in the cortex have been found to be connected to each other in a non-random fashion forming structured local cortical circuits. The experimental data show that there are significant number of reciprocal connections between the pyramidal neurons and that there is a prevalence of other motifs involving groups of three or more highly interconnected neurons \cite{markram1997,thomson2002, Song2005, Perin2011}. Fast spiking interneurons and pyramidal cells are reciprocally connected with probability close to one\cite{Yoshimura2005}. Together, these results provide a picture of local cortical microcircuit where (i) connectivity motifs occur greater than expected in a random network, and (ii) a very few strong connections dominate in a sea of weak synapses.

What effects does such a fine connectivity structure have on cortical dynamics? Here we studied the simplest type of fine structure: bidirectionality. We address the question by studying the effects of excess bidirectional connections in the framework of Balanced networks \cite{carl1996, carl1998, carl2004}, since this framework has been successful in explaining several ubiquitous features of cortical dynamics without resorting to fine tuning of parameters \cite{softky1993, Holt1996, roxin2011}. These networks automatically find an operating point where total excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the neurons in the network approximately cancel or balance each other.  Hence, the effective net inputs that the neurons receive are of $O(Threshold)$. Modulations or changes in the $O(Threshold)$ inputs lead to emergence of interesting network dynamics. In the standard balanced network the connectivity is assumed to be random. Fine structure in the connectivity could lead to significant $O(Threshold)$ changes in the total input to neurons and we will study the effects of bidirectionality on the total input. Neurons in a random balanced network receive weakly time-correlated $O(Threshold)$ inputs or fast fluctuating inputs. As a result, the spike time auto-correlations decorrelate rapidly\cite{carl1996, carl1998}.  However, this is not consistent with what has been observed in cortical recordings. In fact, the power spectrum of membrane voltages recorded in the cortex show e significant low frequency components. \cite{Tan2014}. 						

We studied the effect of bidirectionality of in a two population network consisting of Excitatory(E) and Inhibitory(I) neurons. We considered bidirectionality within each population(E-to-E and, I-to-I) and between the two populations(E-to-I) to address the following questions. (i) What are the effects of excess bidirectionality on the dynamics in a balanced network? (ii) What are the effects on functional properties? (iii) What are the effects on fluctuations and spiking statistics?
We investigated these questions using numerical simulations of large scale spiking network  model of rodent V1 (see Methods). 
 

%As we show, in the presence of bidirectional connections, the inputs are no longer time-uncorrelated, but are fluctuating slower than in a random network. This leads to an increase in decorrelation times. However, to what degree does the decorrelation time slow down and what other response properties are significantly affected? We show that in a conductance based model of layer 2/3 rodent V1, only at very high levels of bidirectional connections in I-to-I leads to a slowing down fluctuations and an increase in the trial-to-trial variability. \\




%A Balanced network is assumed to have strong synapses and sparse connectivity. \\

% We study bidirectionality in Balanced networks since it provides a general explanation for the ubiquitous cortical feature of asynchronous irregular spiking statistics. \\

%We study effects of excess bidirectionality in a network of binary neurons and in a model of rodent V1. We show that excess bidirectionality leads to slowing down of dynamics.
